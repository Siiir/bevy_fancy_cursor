# bevy_fancy_cursor
Plagin for bevy. Uses bevy's `ImageBundle` to crate a custom cursor from file with image.

# Contribute
 if you want to see project growing and `FancyCursor` becoming more generic.

# How to install?
#### bevy_fancy_cursor = { git = "https://github.com/Siiir/bevy_fancy_cursor" }
Until I find some time to chat with bevy team and made better docs this mini-project won't be published on crates.io.  
You can help me in this though.

# PS
Sorry, if I harmed English language anywhere.
